            Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called Yellow

So, then, I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know
You know I love you so?
You know I love you so?

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow

I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

And your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know
For you, I'd bleed myself dry?
For you, I'd bleed myself dry

It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for

Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do
